# Covid Shopping Assistant
Team Zoomie has chosen *The Social Distancing Social Club*â€™s proposal to take through to build. The proposal explores and attempts to provide a solution to  the shopping experience during an ongoing pandemic. The provided solution is a mobile application that aims to assist shoppers in maintaining social distancing rules and regulations, whilst also improving time-efficiency when grocery shopping. This will be achieved by helping shoppers pre-plan their trip to the grocery store. The key features include: (1) social distancing reminders, (2) reminders to use COVIDSafe, and (3) create and modify shopping lists.

### How to connect to the server  
1. Proxy ssh connection
	1. Log into moss
		- `ssh <student number>@moss.labs.eait.uq.edu.au`
	2. Log into web server

## How to install local copy of Web-server  
1. Install python 3 onto your computer. This will vary depending on your operating system. (Just google it please)

	- The instructions are for Windows but MacOS and Linux setup is similar.
3. Create a virtual python environment in the directory of your choice. 
	- Linux (and Mac): `python3 -m venv env`
	- Windows: `python -m venv env`
4. Activate virtual environment.

	- Windows: `env\Scripts\Activate`
5. Clone the git repository. `git clone https://github.com/TeamZoomie/CovidShoppingAssistant.git`
