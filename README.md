# Covid Shopping Assistant
Team Zoomie has chosen *The Social Distancing Social Club*â€™s proposal to take through to build. The proposal explores and attempts to provide a solution to  the shopping experience during an ongoing pandemic. The provided solution is a mobile application that aims to assist shoppers in maintaining social distancing rules and regulations, whilst also improving time-efficiency when grocery shopping. This will be achieved by helping shoppers pre-plan their trip to the grocery store. The key features include: (1) social distancing reminders, (2) reminders to use COVIDSafe, and (3) create and modify shopping lists.
